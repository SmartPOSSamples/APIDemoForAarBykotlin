# APIDemo by Kotlin

APIDemo is an example application designed to demonstrate the interaction with our Custom API, specifically tailored for Android developers who are looking to integrate our services into their smart POS applications. 
It primarily focuses on showcasing the use of each device interface within the CloudPOS SDK. It aims to assist customers in better understanding the meaning, usage, and call methods of each interface, without encapsulating specific business logic.

## Features

- Individual demonstration item for each device.
- Each interface of every device, such as open, close, is listed as a separate demo item. This format facilitates users to comprehend the parameters and methods involved in interface calls.
- This version is written in Kotlin, while the other APIDemoForAar is in Java.
